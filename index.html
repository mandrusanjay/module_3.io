	<div><p>Well, I don’t about you but it happens with me every time I see a chicken dish on my dining table. I jump on with happiness and lose my patience to wait even a single moment. At times, me and my brothers fight like cats and dogs because I always pick out the largest share. Out of unnumbered of chicken dishes, I love ‘Tandoori Chicken’ the most, though I like others too. Whenever my mom asks ‘what you want to have in meal’, I vigorously shout ‘Tandoori Chicken’.

No matter, how much and how often I eat it, my hunger for Tandoori Chicken never dies. Sometimes, I get scolded that you would gain weight or fall sick eating a whole plate in one sitting but who cares as long as my favorite dish is in front of me. The more crunchy, gravy, spicy, tangy it is, the more I like it. This mouth-watering dish just drives me crazy.

People say, restaurant foods are the best but I differ. My mom cooks the best Tandoori Chicken in the world. Her cooking skill is the only reason I love this dish so much. If you haven’t tried Tandoori Chicken yet, I must say, you still don’t know what a scrumptious dish tastes like. Try this dish today and now itself. This lip-smacking dish will twist your tongue with its savory flavor.

    <div><p>The production of beef produces requires a lot of energy and leaves a huge carbon footprint on planet earth. The process of producing beef goes far beyond raising cattle. It includes heavy water use, immense amounts of land to grow grain and/or corn, and requires an almost endless amount transportation. We have to consider not only the amount of land the cattle physically occupy, but also the amount of land used to grow the huge amount of food they require. To put it into perspective, the production of beef uses “30% of the earth’s land mass” (Peta 2013). In addition, it takes 31.5kWh of energy to produce 1lb of beef, approximately 58lbs of CO2 emissions (Federal Register 2010). Speaking of energy, the amount of grain fed to cattle is staggeringly high. Including beef cattle and dairy cattle if all that feed “were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million" (Pimentel, David 2014). And yet another aspect of this, perhaps an externality effect on the environment is deforestation, land dehydration, and contamination of water sources from runoff.

    Another aspect we looked at was water consumption. The amount of water required to raise cattle for beef is shockingly high. And a lot of this is not only due to the direct consumption of water by the cattle, but the indirect consumption through the food they eat. The crops themselves require a lot of water as well. Combine the water for agriculture for the beef cattle and the direct consumption of water and we find that “nearly half of the water used in the United States” is strictly used for the beef cattle industry. To put this into perspective, and to understand what “50%” of American water use looks like, let’s look at the followin...

	<div><p>Did you know that sushi is the most popular Asian food in the world? Sushi is my favorite food because it is tasty, it brings back old memories, and it makes me happy. Therefore, this means I can go to any place around the world and I can find sushi. Sushi is my favorite food because it is tasty, makes me happy, and brings back old memories.   Sushi is my favorite food because it brings back old memories. I was once in a restaurant for my birthday, and saw John Travolta, in fact, he was eating the same kind of sushi as I was. This was a fantastic memory. Sushi has given me a lot of awesome memories. Every time I eat sushi I remember old memories, an example would be the time I met John Travolta. Sushi is my favorite food because it brings back old memories. Sushi is my favorite because it is very tasty.

	 I like how the mixture of rice and seafood combine, however, some people say the avocado is also a big element in the sushi. Regardless the rice, this dish is a very healthy and a very tasty plate. Sushi is becoming very popular and also very multi-cultural. Despite the fact that its Japanese, many countries put their own finishing touches onto it. As a result, sushi will always have a different taste depending on where it’s served. Sushi is my favorite food because it is very tasty.  Sushi is my favorite food because it makes me happy. Did you know that food can make a person happy? As a result, every time I eat sushi I become very happy. The flavors of the sushi make me just want to stand on a table and dance. Every time I put a sushi roll I get a big smile on my face. People may argue that everything you eat is tastier when eating it with someone you love.

	  Yet, I can eat sushi alone and still have a smile on my face; this is why sushi is my favorite food. A reason why sushi is my favorite food is because it makes me
    On the first night of Chanukah, my family and I sat down to our traditional holiday dinner. With the smell of warm food being prepared, everyone anticipated the meal to come. Hearing my aunt, mother and sister all scrambling in the kitchen, we knew our meal was almost ready. I helped bring out the brisket, noodle koogle, potato latkes, applesauce and other Jewish dishes. As everyone settled around the dinner table, there was one item that was completely consumed within the first three minutes. This was not an item my mother typically made each night. In fact, she only attempted to bake it once a year. </p><a href="#header-nav">Back to the Top</a></div>
